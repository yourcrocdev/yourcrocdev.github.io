            <p>Saint Nicholas of Myra - a 4th Century Bishop is what is now Turkey. He was renowned for his generosity and care.  </p>
            <p>One famous story tells of Nicholas secretly providing dowries for three impoverished sisters by tossing gold coins through their window, which landed in stockings hung to dry.</p>

            <h1>Next we're heading to Medieval Times.</h1>
            <p>After his death, December 6th, which was his feast day, became widely celebrated across Europe. It was particularly celebrated in Germany. </p>
            <p>In the Netherlands, Sinterklaas became a thing. This was where a Bishop-like figure delivered gifts to children. He travelled by horse, and was accompanied by helpers (elves??).</p>

            <p>Over time, the Dutch settled in New York, and brought over the Sinterklaas tradition. Over time, the name evolved into "Santa Claus"  </p>
            <p>In the 19th Century, Washington Irving's writing described Saint Nicholas as jolly, and flew over rooftops (which began the modern transformation). </p>

            <h1>Several books, poems and ads later.</h1>
            <p>In 1823, the poem "A visit from St. Nicholas" made the image of Santa being plump and cheerful popular, along with his reindeer.</p>
            <p>The Coca Cola Company showed advertisements that depicted Santa as jolly and red suited. Santa basically became Coca Cola's mascot at Christmas.</p>

            <h1>Ok. Ok. Back to present time now. Let's summarise.</h1>
            <p> As you can see, over time, Santa has been widely regarded as plump, and many foreign influences have shaped him to what he is today, a big man delivering presents with his reindeer.  </p>
            <p>Question is: do you believe in Santa? </p>
